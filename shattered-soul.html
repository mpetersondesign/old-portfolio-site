          Shattered Soul is an atmospheric platformer with an emphasis on
          collectibles and level exploration. It was originally designed as a
          puzzle game but development pivoted halfway through the course to a
          simpler format. We quickly decided to forego any development on the
          puzzle half of the game and focus on platforming and exploration.

        <h3>Project Overview:</h3>
        <p>
          The mechanics of the game revolve around this "Darkness" and
          "Saturation" system. As the player explores the world, a radius of
          encroaching darkness descends upon them. This effectively acts as a
          timer, prompting the player to move and explore the world with some
          degree of exertion; this wasn't a game a player could sit around and
          do nothing in. To fight off the inevitable death timer, players would
          have to search for and collect "souls", collectibles that fought back
          the darkness and gave the player more time to find the level's exit.
          At the junction between different sections of the level, the player
          would pass through "checkpoint" areas that would calculate how many
          souls had been collected and affect the "saturation" of the world
          around them depending on the extent they went to collect them. If the
          player collected a certain amount of souls, the world would become
          brighter and more colorful, conversely, if the player didn't collect
          enough, the world would become more bland and unappealing, signifying
          progress towards either extreme.

        <h3>My Role:</h3>
        <p>
          As the gameplay designer, my job was to take the high concept (Puzzle
          platformer, turned "exploration" platformer) into a workable and
          playable idea we could execute on. Working with the rest of the team,
          I shifted our creative focus towards ways we could make this a unique
          experience. My solution became a mechanic that would have a
          distinctive effect on aspects of our game like player motivation and
          the conventional "health" system. <br /><br />Aside from designing the
          core mechanics of the game, I was also solely in charge of most of the
          programming. My main focus was the character controller; I wanted to
          make sure our character was fun and interesting to control in these
          vast spaces meant for expedient exploration, something which I was
          greatly praised for during testing and production of the game.
          <br /><br />
          This also meant I was solely in charge of debug implementations,
          analytics implementations, and handling any bugs or technical errors
          during the duration of the project.

        <h3>Project Hurdles:</h3>
        <p>
          Although the game jam period was three days, I contracted a moderate
          illness after the first day that left me unable to contribute to the
          project. My team and I lost an entire day of in-engine work as a
          result, and I ended up having to put in extra crunch hours up until
          the final seconds of submission in order to accomplish the level of
          polish I expected from the project despite my absence for a third of
          the time period allowed. I'm proud of what I was able to accomplish
          despite the time loss.

        <h3>Project Reception:</h3>
        <p>
          The project received higher than a 5/5, receiving bonus points for
          "Core Gameplay".
