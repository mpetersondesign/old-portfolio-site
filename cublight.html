        <h3>Project Overview:</h3>
        <p>
          Our goal for the project was to create a fun, abstract atmosphere
          using only primative shapes and limited visual assets. We did not have
          an artist on the team, meaning that we had to stick to very simplistic
          models outside of the assets in the game that were base primitives.

          <br /><br />
          The game is very simple, you start at a specific position on a 2x2
          grid map and work your way from top to bottom, each level expanding
          the size of the map on each axis. You can shoot, you can dash, and you
          can "execute" enemies by dashing into them while they're low on
          health. You gain EXP from defeating enemies and can receive "perks" on
          level up to accentuate your arsenal. There is a boss at the end of the
          game.

        <h3>My Role:</h3>
        <p>
          Our team was large (12 people) and I was a late addition, but I took
          up the role of "Quality Director" and Gameplay Designer. I helped
          design the EXP system and the implementation of dashing and
          executions, as well as the hat system. I regularly offered direction
          on user experience design, and helped guide some technical
          implementation.
          <br /><br />
          During my role as a quality director, I was in charge of documentation
          between commits and builds, as well as presenting information to
          shareholders and driving presentations.
        </p>

        <h3>Project Hurdles:</h3>
        <p>
          As mentioned, our team composition left some artistic limitations;
          when I was brought onto the team, the theme of "simplistic primitives"
          was already decided. The rest of the team was dedicated to using
          simple geometric shapes to represent everything in the game. I voiced
          concerns about this decision when we quickly ran out of simple shapes
          to use that would appropriately deliver adequate amounts of
          significance and feedback. I guided the team away from this design
          decision while keeping the core aesthetic intact.
