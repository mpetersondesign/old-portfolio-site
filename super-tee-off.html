          Super Tee Off! is a pocket-sized kinesthetic project that emulates the
          experience of being a golf ball launched off the tee. Using motion,
          sound, and visual effects, I make this small, short experience a fun,
          bite-sized game.

        <h3>Project Overview:</h3>
        <p>
          We were tasked with coming up with an interactive experience for a
          metaphorical game that we could create. The experience was supposed to
          simulate different kinematic experiences; motion, sound, visual
          effects, et cetera.
          <br /><br />
          Super Tee Off! was a bit of a different approach to this project;
          whereas many people created first-person simulation experiences, I
          instead wanted to turn my kinematic emulation into a small mini-game.

          <br /><br />I chose golf, a game where the kinematics are very
          distinctive, and most of the work is done through physics. There are
          many very specific, memorable, and iconic elements of the golf swing
          experience; the signature sound of a club slicing the air, the grass
          that kicks up, the sound of the ball taking off, and the satisfying
          arc the ball takes towards its destination.

          <br /><br />I wanted to put these elements together in a tiny
          experience for the player, so I created a mini game where you, as a
          golf ball, are swung at by a golfer taking a random (but fairly
          accurate) shot at the hole. You have a bit of control over the ball as
          it makes it's way towards the goal, including a small amount of drift
          left/right and a bit of control over your gravity/drop rate, all
          dynamically influenced by the current velocity of the ball.

        <h3>My Role:</h3>
        <p>
          These were solo projects, so I had to do everything from the modeling
          to the programming. Everything was done in Unity and Blender over the
          course of a week.

        <h3>Project Hurdles:</h3>
        <p>
          Coming up with a kinesthetic experience was a tough job alone; the
          criteria were pretty strict and I had to come up with an experience
          that wouldn't be nauseating to the user. My first ideas involved
          bowling and pinball, as I thought a sports-centric game would be fun
          "from the perspective of the ball". Unfortunately, many sports involve
          the ball spinning, whirling, or being tossed to and fro, which would
          make for an uncomfortable experience for the user. I had to get
          express permission to use third-person, although Super Tee Off! does
          have a zoom parameter that can be used to give a first person
          experience in-game.

        <h3>Project Reception:</h3>
        <p>
          The project received a 5/5 in all categories, including game feel,
          sound and visual design, and interactivity.
